### Design and Analysis of a Current Mirror Circuit

You are tasked with designing and analyzing a current mirror circuit based on the following specifications:

- **Voltage Gain (Av)** must be greater than 10 V/V
- **Supply Voltage (Vdd)** is 1.8V
- **Power Consumption (P)** should not exceed 1W
- You need to design the circuit for two different current ratios: **1:1 and 1:2**
- Consider three different values for the channel length (L):
  - **L = 180 nm**
  - **L = 500 nm**
  - **L = 1 μm**
- The **W/L ratio** must remain the same for all three cases.

### Basic Theory of Current Mirror Circuits

A current mirror is a key component in analog electronics, used mainly for controlling current in circuits like amplifiers, voltage regulators, and biasing networks. Its main purpose is to ensure that the current flowing through the output transistor matches the reference current as closely as possible.

The typical structure of a current mirror involves two MOSFETs operating in saturation mode, where one sets the reference current (often via a resistor or an external current source), and the other mirrors this current at the output. The key advantages of a current mirror are:

- **High output resistance**, which ensures that the current remains stable and consistent despite small changes in voltage.
- **Low input resistance**, which allows it to efficiently source current.
- **Matching transistor characteristics** are essential for accurate current replication.
- **Design challenges** like channel length modulation and the Early effect (which can distort current), must be considered to ensure the mirror works reliably.

### Step-by-Step Approach

To design and analyze the circuit, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the current mirror circuit** based on the specifications provided (with a supply voltage of 1.8V, and the appropriate current ratios).
2. **Choose transistor dimensions** (W/L) that ensure the desired voltage gain and current ratio for each case (1:1 and 1:2).
3. **Simulate the circuit** using tools like LTspice to evaluate performance under different conditions:
   - **DC analysis** to check for steady-state operation.
   - **AC analysis** to examine frequency response and voltage gain.
   - **Transient analysis** to evaluate how the circuit behaves over time and under changing conditions.

### Channel Lengths to Consider

You will analyze the current mirror circuit with three different channel lengths (L):

- **L = 180 nm** (shorter length, potentially higher current drive, but could suffer from higher short-channel effects)
- **L = 500 nm** (moderate length, balanced trade-off between performance and power consumption)
- **L = 1 μm** (longer length, generally offers more stable current but might require more area and power)

### Key Things to Keep in Mind

- The **W/L ratio** (width-to-length ratio of the MOSFET) will remain constant across all cases to maintain similar performance in terms of current drive and power consumption. 
- You must ensure the circuit meets the target specifications: voltage gain greater than 10, supply voltage of 1.8V, and power consumption below 1W.
- Analyze the circuit under all three channel lengths and evaluate how the performance (current mirroring accuracy, voltage gain, and power consumption) changes with each.
